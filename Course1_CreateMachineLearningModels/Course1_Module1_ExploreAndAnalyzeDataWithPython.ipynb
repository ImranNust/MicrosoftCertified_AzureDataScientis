    "Unsurprisingly, the role of a data scientist primarily involves exploring and analyzing data. The results of an analysis might form the basis of a report or a machine learning model, but it all begins with data, with Python being the most popular programming language for data scientists.\n",
    "\n",
    "After decades of open-source development, Python provides extensive functionality with powerful statistical and numerical libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "- NumPy and Pandas simplify analyzing and manipulating data\n",
    "- Matplotlib provides attractive data visualizations\n",
    "- Skit-learn offers simple and effective predictive data analysis\n",
    "- TensorFlow and PyTorch supply machine learning and deep learning capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, a data analysis project is designed to establish insights around a particular scenario or to test a hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose a university professor collects data from their students, including the number of lectures attended, the hours spent studying, and the final grade achieved on the end of term exam. The professor could analyze the data to determine if there is a relationship between the amount of studying a student undertakes and the final grade they achieve. The professor might use the data to test a hypothesis that only students who study for a minimum number of hours can expect to achieve a passing grade.\n",

The box part of the plot shows where the inner two quartiles of the data reside - so in this case, half of the grades are between approximately 36 and 63. The whiskers extending from the box show the outer two quartiles; so the other half of the grades in this case are between 0 and 36 or 63 and 100. The line in the box indicates the median value.\n",

    "\n",
    "Real world data can contain many different issues that can affect the utility of the data, and our interpretation of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to realize that most real-world data are influenced by factors that weren't recorded at the time. For example, we might have a table of race-car track times alongside engine sizes, but various other factors that weren't written down—such as the weather—probably also played a role. If problematic, the influence of these factors can often be reduced by increasing the size of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other situations data points that are clearly outside of what is expected—also known as ‘outliers’—can sometimes be safely removed from analyses, though care must be taken to not remove data points that provide real insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common issue in real-world data is bias. Bias refers to a tendency to select certain types of values more frequently than others, in a way that misrepresents the underlying population, or ‘real world’. Bias can sometimes be identified by exploring data while keeping in mind basic knowledge about where the data came from.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, real-world data will always have issues, but this is often a surmountable problem. Remember to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Check for missing values and badly recorded data\n",
    "- Consider removal of obvious outliers\n",
    "- Consider what real-world factors might affect your analysis and consider if your dataset size is large enough to handle this\n",
    "- Check for biased raw data and consider your options to fix this, if found\n",

    "For learning purposes we have just treated the value 1 is a true outlier here and excluded it. In the real world, though, it would be unusual to exclude data at the extremes without more justification when our sample size is so small. This is because the smaller our sample size, the more likely it is that our sampling is a bad representation of the whole population (here, the population means grades for all students, not just our 22). For example, if we sampled study time for another 1000 students, we might find that it's actually quite common to not study much!\n",
    "\n",
    "When we have more data available, our sample becomes more reliable. This makes it easier to consider outliers as being values that fall below or above percentiles within which most of the data lie. For example, the following code uses the Pandas quantile function to exclude observations below the 0.01th percentile (the value above which 99% of the data reside)."

    "The chart shows bars for both grade and study hours for each student; but it's not easy to compare because the values are on different scales. Grades are measured in grade points, and range from 3 to 97; while study time is measured in hours and ranges from 1 to 16.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common technique when dealing with numeric data in different scales is to normalize the data so that the values retain their proportional distribution, but are measured on the same scale. To accomplish this, we'll use a technique called MinMax scaling that distributes the values proportionally on a scale of 0 to 1. You could write the code to apply this transformation; but the **Scikit-Learn** library provides a scaler to do it for you."

    "The correlation statistic is a value between -1 and 1 that indicates the strength of a relationship. Values above 0 indicate a positive correlation (high values of one variable tend to coincide with high values of the other), while values below 0 indicate a negative correlation (high values of one variable tend to coincide with low values of the other). In this case, the correlation value is close to 1; showing a strongly positive correlation between study time and grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Data scientists often quote the maxim \"correlation is not causation\". In other words, as tempting as it might be, you shouldn't interpret the statistical correlation as explaining why one of the values is high. In the case of the student data, the statistics demonstrates that students with high grades tend to also have high amounts of study time; but this is not the same as proving that they achieved high grades because they studied a lot. The statistic could equally be used as evidence to support the nonsensical conclusion that the students studied a lot because their grades were going to be high.\n",

    "Again, it looks like there's a discernible pattern in which the students who studied the most hours are also the students who got the highest grades.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see this more clearly by adding a regression line (or a line of best fit) to the plot that shows the general trend in the data. To do this, we'll use a statistical technique called least squares regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Warning - Math Ahead!Cast your mind back to when you were learning how to solve linear equations in school, and recall that the slope-intercept form of a linear equation looks like this: $y = mx + b$\n",
    "In this equation, y and x are the coordinate variables, m is the slope of the line, and b is the y-intercept (where the line goes through the Y-axis).In the case of our scatter plot for our student data, we already have our values for x (StudyHours) and y (Grade), so we just need to calculate the intercept and slope of the straight line that lies closest to those points. Then we can form a linear equation that calculates a new y value on that line for each of our x (StudyHours) values - to avoid confusion, we'll call this new y value f(x) (because it's the output from a linear equation function based on x). The difference between the original y (Grade) value and the f(x) value is the error between our regression line and the actual Grade achieved by the student. Our goal is to calculate the slope and intercept for a line with the lowest overall error.Specifically, we define the overall error by taking the error for each point, squaring it, and adding all the squared errors together. The line of best fit is the line that gives us the lowest value for the sum of the squared errors - hence the name least squares regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, you don't need to code the regression calculation yourself - the SciPy package includes a stats class that provides a linregress method to do the hard work for you. This returns (among other things) the coefficients you need for the slope equation - slope (m) and intercept (b) based on a given pair of variable samples you want to compare."
