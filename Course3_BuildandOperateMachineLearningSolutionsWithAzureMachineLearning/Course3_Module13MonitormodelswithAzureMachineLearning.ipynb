    "\n",
    "You can use Application Insights to monitor telemetry from many kinds of application, including applications that are not running in Azure. All that's required is a low-overhead instrumentation package to capture and send the telemetry data to Application Insights. The necessary package is already included in Azure Machine Learning Web services, so you can use it to capture and review telemetry from models published with Azure Machine Learning.\n",

    "To log telemetry in application insights from an Azure machine learning service, you must have an Application Insights resource associated with your Azure Machine Learning workspace, and you must configure your service to use it for telemetry logging.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**<h2>Associate Application Insights with a workspace</h2>**\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create an Azure Machine Learning workspace, you can select an Azure Application Insights resource to associate with it. If you do not select an existing Application Insights resource, a new one is created in the same resource group as your workspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can determine the Application Insights resource associated with your workspace by viewing the Overview page of the workspace blade in the Azure portal, or by using the get_details() method of a Workspace object as shown in the following code example:\n",

    "ws = Workspace.from_config()\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**<h2>Enable Application Insights for a service</h2>**\n",
    "When deploying a new real-time service, you can enable Application Insights in the deployment configuration for the service, as shown in this example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "dep_config = AciWebservice.deploy_configuration(cpu_cores = 1,\n",
    "                                                memory_gb = 1,\n",

    "If you want to enable Application Insights for a service that is already deployed, you can modify the deployment configuration for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) based services in the Azure portal. Alternatively, you can update any web service by using the Azure Machine Learning SDK, like this:\n",
