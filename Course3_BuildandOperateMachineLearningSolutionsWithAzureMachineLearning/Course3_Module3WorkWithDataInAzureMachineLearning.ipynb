    "- You can access any datastore by name, but you may want to consider changing the default datastore (which is initially the built-in **workspaceblobstore** datastore).\n",
    "\n",
    "To change the default datastore, use the **set_default_datastore()** method:\n",

    "**<center><h1>Introduction to datasets</h1></center>**\n",

    "\n",
    "**<h2>Types of dataset</h2>**\n",
    "\n",
    "Datasets are typically based on files in a datastore, though they can also be based on URLs and other sources. You can create the following types of dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tabular:** The data is read from the dataset as a table. You should use this type of dataset when your data is consistently structured and you want to work with it in common tabular data structures, such as Pandas dataframes.\n",
    "- **File:** The dataset presents a list of file paths that can be read as though from the file system. Use this type of dataset when your data is unstructured, or when you need to process the data at the file level (for example, to train a convolutional neural network from a set of image files).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**<h2>Creating and registering datasets</h2>**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the visual interface in Azure Machine Learning studio or the Azure Machine Learning SDK to create datasets from individual files or multiple file paths. The paths can include wildcards (for example, /files/*.csv) making it possible to encapsulate data from a large number of files in a single dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you've created a dataset, you can register it in the workspace to make it available for use in experiments and data processing pipelines later.\n",
    "\n",
    "**<h2>Creating and registering tabular datasets</h2>**\n",

    "To create a tabular dataset using the SDK, use the **from_delimited_files** method of the **Dataset.Tabular** class, like this:\n",

    "- All .csv files in the **data/files/archive/** folder.\n",
