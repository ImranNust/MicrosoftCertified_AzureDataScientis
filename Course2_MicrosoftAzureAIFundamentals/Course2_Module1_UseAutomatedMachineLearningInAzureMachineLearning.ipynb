    "For example, suppose Adventure Works Cycles is a business that rents cycles in a city. The business could use historic data to train a model that predicts daily rental demand in order to make sure sufficient staff and cycles are available.\n",

    "To do this, Adventure Works could create a machine learning model that takes information about a specific day (the day of week, the anticipated weather conditions, and so on) as an input, and predicts the expected number of rentals as an output.\n",

    "Mathematically, you can think of machine learning as a way of defining a function (let's call it $f$) that operates on one or more features of something (which we'll call $x$) to calculate a predicted label ($y$) - like this:\n",
